# App-game
This app provides a gamified approach to the “buoy location” problem: multiple users can compete using multiple tablets, the layouts are sent off to the cloud where they are evaluated, and the respective scores are then shown online. In two outreach events, over 100 participants ranging from primary schools to parents and visitors from industry participated.
